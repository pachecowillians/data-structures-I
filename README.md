# Data structures I
 These are the programs that i made in the Data Structures 1 course.
 In this course i learn how to organize and store data in structures, and relate them making lists, and trees in the C language.

 All the most commons data structures are implemented here like:
 - Linked lists
 - Doubly linked lists
 - Circular lists
 - Circular doubly linked lists
 - Queues
 - Stacks
 - Hash tables
 - Binary tree
 - AVL tree
 - N-ary tree
 - Generic data types
